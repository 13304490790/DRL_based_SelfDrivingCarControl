---

### Version 0.5

#### Updated!

- Mac and Linux version simulator is available!! :) 

#### Issues

- Text position changes depending on resolution

- More DRL algorithms!

#### Issues

- Text position changes depending on resolution
- Linux and Mac version of the simulator
- Plot is not responding
- There is no 'The end' condition
- Sometimes heading of the vehicle is tilted

---

### Version 0.3

#### Updated!

- There are three front warning sensors for vehicles (Front Left, Center, Right)
- Vehicles control their speed same as the speed of the vehicle at the front when there is front warning.
- Vehicle control parameters were changed

#### Issues

- Major Issue!
  - It has Null error. The game doesn't stop but I will try to remove it. 
- Text position changes depending on resolution
- Linux and Mac version of the simulator
- DRL algorithm is needed to be fixed!! 

---

### Version 0.2

#### Updated!

- The major problem is solved! `No disconnection` happens in 150000 steps! Yeah~ ðŸ˜ƒ
- There is `no error message` in simulator, so it doesn't need to build it as a developer version

#### Issues

- Speed of training and observing / testing is so different
- It needs more front sensors! 
- Forward control is so rapid!!
- Text position changes depending on resolution

---

### version 0.1

#### Updated

- Sometimes connection of simulator and DRL code is disconnected
- Simulator is developer version, sometimes error message can be appeared, so please close the console
- Simulator is window version. After some major problems are solved, I will make Mac and Linux version.
